At the recent [ORCID Outreach meeting](http://orcid.org/content/orcid-outreach-meeting-and-codefest-may-2014) in Chicago, [Roy Boverhof](https://mobile.twitter.com/Boverhof) took second prize at the [Codefest](http://www.hackathon.io/events/1944) for developing an ORCID plugin for WordPress. You can learn more about the project here: http://pigsonthewing.org.uk/orcid-plugin-for-wordpress/ or access the project here: https://github.com/ServerDotBiz/orcid. I just installed the plugin and am posting so that I can test the commenting feature. Roy is the developer for the [Scopus Feedback Wizard](https://www.mchabib.com/projects-portfolio/scopus-author-feedback-wizard/) and the [Scopus2ORCID wizard](http://orcid.scopusfeedback.com/).

Worth noting, Roy previously [won the ORCID/Dryad Codefest](https://www.elsevier.com/connect/behind-the-scenes-at-the-orciddryad-codefest) in May of 2013 for developing [orcidlive.org](http://orcidlive.org/) for which he won a trip to CERN to participate in the [ODIN "Big Bang" 1st year conference and codesprint](http://indico.cern.ch/event/238868/other-view?view=standard).

Incidentally, I had the opportunity to give a lightning talk at the ORCID Outreach meeting. My slides are available here: http://www.slideshare.net/ORCIDSlides/cris-orcid-elsevierlightningtalkhabib. I also had the chance to speak on an [ORCID hosted panel at the Society for Scholarly Publishing Annual Meeting](http://www.sspnet.org/events/past-events/2014-annual-meeting/2014-schedule/) a few weeks later. Slides from that panel are available here: http://www.slideshare.net/ORCIDSlides/ssp2014-panel-how-orcid-is-facilitating-interoperable-exchange-of-information-in-publishing.

Testing commenting with the ORCID plugin while logged-in.

Darn, no ORCID field is showing for when leaving a comment.

That's odd. Please check the settings on the plugins options page.

If that's OK, please raise a bug, on the Github page, listing those settings and the theme you use.
